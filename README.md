If you want to run this app in a browser via live server, you need to install "CORS unblock" extention to your browser( I tested it on Chrome, everything works fine there. If errors happen, or CORS unblock is not available for your browser, consider using Chrome aswell). 

Once installed CORS unblock, run the script on a live server and open the console.

You can also run this app on node.js where no "CORS unblock" extention is needed.

To view the test suites run "npm install" to install Jest.
